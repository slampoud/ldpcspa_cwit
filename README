Compiling the code: on a UNIX machine with a C compiler (we have tested with
gcc), and GNU make, edit the Makefile to match your compiler and type 'make'.

We have included an example matrix file (example_graph.g) to illustrate the 
matrix format. 
The matrix file is a simple text file. The first entry gives the number of 
checks (141 in our example); the second entry gives the number of bits (282
in our example). The subsequent entries each represent an edge between a 
a check and a bit, in check:bit format. The checks and bits are numbered
starting at zero (0). The entries are separated by a single space. 

For example, you could use the given matrix file like so:
./ldpcspa -g example_graph.g -s 4 -R 0.5 -F 1000 -Q 
where the signal-to-noise ratio is 4, the rate is 0.5, the decoder generates
1000 random frames, and the printing out of frames that failed to decode is 
suppressed (by -Q). 

Running the binary without arguments, like so:
./ldpcspa
will result in a message explaining the commandline options.
